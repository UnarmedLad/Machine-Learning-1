    "* Put your and your teammates' names in the body of the email\n",
    "* Attach the .IPYNB (IPython Notebook) file containing your code and answers. Naming of the file follows the same rule as the subject line. For example, if the subject line is \"lab01\\_Kingma\\_Hu\", the attached file should be \"lab01\\_Kingma\\_Hu.ipynb\". Only use underscores (\"\\_\") to connect names, otherwise the files cannot be parsed.\n",

    "* Please write your answers right below the questions.\n",
    "* Among the first lines of your notebook should be \"%pylab inline\". This imports all required modules, and your plots will appear inline.\n",

    "### 2.5 Additional questions (10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "a) (5 points) Why is $\\beta=\\frac{1}{0.2^2}$ the best choice of $\\beta$ in section 2.4?\n",
    "\n",
    "b) (5 points) In the case of Bayesian linear regression, both the posterior of the parameters $p(\\bw \\;|\\; \\bt, \\alpha, \\beta)$ and the predictive distribution $p(t \\;|\\; \\bw, \\beta)$ are Gaussian. In consequence (and conveniently), $p(t \\;|\\; \\bt, \\alpha, \\beta)$ is also Gaussian (See MLPR section 3.3.2 and homework 2 question 4). This is actually one of the (rare) cases where we can make Bayesian predictions without resorting to approximative methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have to work with some model $p(t\\;|\\;x,\\bw)$ with parameters $\\bw$, where the posterior distribution $p(\\bw\\;|\\;\\mathcal{D})$ given dataset $\\mathcal{D}$ can not be integrated out when making predictions, but where you can still generate samples from the posterior distribution of the parameters. Explain how you can still make approximate Bayesian predictions using samples from the parameters' posterior distribution.\n",

    "## Answers\n",
    "a) In section 2.4, we considered data points generated by the `gen_sinusoidal2` method. In its implementation, we considered a regression function $h(x) = \\sin(x)$ (or $h(x) = \\sin(2 \\pi x)$, depending on whether you follow Bishop or the lab exercise) with target value deviation $\\sigma = 0.2$. In the book, it is said that the precision $\\beta$ should be set to $\\beta = 1/\\sigma^2$ (see page 24). This is supported by the deduction in page 142, equation (3.21): we see that maximizing the log likelihood of (3.11) wrt $\\beta$ yields a $\\beta_{ML}$ that is of exactly this form. So in conclusion, setting $\\beta = 1/(0.2)^2$ is consistent with the theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) We can use a sampling scheme (for example Markov chain Monte Carlo, chapter 11.2) to draw a set $z^{(l)}$ of $L$ independent samples from $p(\\bw\\;|\\;\\mathcal{D})$. Now we can approximate $p(t \\;|\\; \\bt, \\alpha, \\beta)$ with $\\frac{1}{L}\\sum_{l=1}^L p(t \\;|\\; z^{(l)}, \\beta)$. This is analogous to equation (11.2). Therefore, this approximation has the correct expected value."
