    "You discover that the predictions by the logistic regression classifier are not good enough for your application: the model is too simple. You want to increase the accuracy of your predictions by using a better model. For this purpose, you're going to use a multilayer perceptron (MLP), a simple kind of neural network. The perceptron wil have a single hidden layer $\\bh$ with $L$ elements. The parameters of the model are $\\bV$ (connections between input $\\bx$ and hidden layer $\\bh$), $\\ba$ (the biases/intercepts of $\\bh$), $\\bW$ (connections between $\\bh$ and $\\log q$) and $\\bb$ (the biases/intercepts of $\\log q$.\n",
