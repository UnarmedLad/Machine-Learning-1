    "Implement gradient-ascent (or descent if you wish) using the combination of a) the log-likelihood objective function and b) the gradients you calculated above.  Run on the training data above and show the log-likehood curve as it learns and a plot of the final model.  Feel free to use available software (eg search for \"minimize.py\" which uses conjugate gradient descent, or something in scipy).  NB: log-likelihood should be monotonically increasing.  You are encouraged to also search and use \"checkgrad\".  (20 points)"
